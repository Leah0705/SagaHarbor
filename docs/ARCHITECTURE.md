# Architecture

SagaHarbor is four independently deployable domain services plus one operations console,
coordinating through Kafka events instead of synchronous calls or a shared database.

- **Order Service** — order intake, idempotent placement, the customer-facing order view, the
  cancellation saga, reconciliation, and the operations projection the console reads from.
- **Inventory Service** — stock levels and concurrency-safe reservation/release.
- **Payment Service** — a deterministic, fictional authorization/decline/refund simulator.
- **Fulfillment Service** — the warehouse workflow state machine and operator actions.
- **Ops Console** (`apps/ops-console`) — a React + TypeScript UI that talks only to service HTTP
  APIs (mainly Order Service's operations projection and Fulfillment Service's action endpoints).

Each service owns exactly one PostgreSQL database. No service connects to another service's
database, and there is no shared JPA or domain-model module — services share event schemas, not
persistence entities.

## Service responsibilities and data ownership

| Service | Owns | Does not own |
|---|---|---|
| Order Service | `Order`, `OrderItem`, idempotency records, the cancellation saga, the operations projection, incidents | stock levels, payment state, warehouse state |
| Inventory Service | `Product`, `StockLevel`, `InventoryReservation`, `InventoryAdjustment` | order data, payment data |
| Payment Service | `Payment`, `PaymentAttempt`, `Refund`, `SimulatorRule`, `OrderPaymentContext` | order data, inventory data |
| Fulfillment Service | `Fulfillment`, `FulfillmentStatusHistory` | order data, payment data, inventory data |

Each service applies its own Flyway migrations. Cross-service reads happen only through a
service's public HTTP API or through the Kafka events it publishes — never through direct database
access. Every cross-service fact ("was payment authorized?") is learned by consuming that owner's
events, not by querying its database. Some data is deliberately duplicated (Order Service keeps a
read-only projection of fulfillment status) in exchange for independence.

### Key domain entities

- **Order** — `orderId` (application-generated UUID), `customerId`, idempotency key and payload
  fingerprint, `items`, `totalAmount` (`BigDecimal`), `currency`, `status`, UTC `Instant`
  timestamps. Line items carry `sku`, integer `quantity`, and `unitPrice`.
- **StockLevel** — `sku`, `availableQuantity`, `reservedQuantity`, and a `version` column for
  optimistic locking. `InventoryReservation` is one row per order (not per SKU), so a multi-item
  order reserves atomically as a whole. `InventoryAdjustment` is an append-only audit row for every
  stock mutation.
- **Payment** — `paymentId`, `orderId` (unique), `amount`, `currencyCode`, `status`
  (`AUTHORIZED`/`DECLINED`/`REFUNDED`). `PaymentAttempt` records every attempt against the
  simulated provider, including ones that never produced a `Payment` row. `OrderPaymentContext` is
  Payment Service's own small projection built from `OrderPlaced.v1` — order id, customer id,
  amount, currency only; never line items, never anything card- or PII-shaped.
- **Fulfillment** — `fulfillmentId`, `orderId` (unique), `status`, a deterministically assigned
  fictional `warehouseId`, optional `assigneeId`, `slaDueAt`, and a `trackingReference` set on
  dispatch. `FulfillmentStatusHistory` is append-only.

## Order state machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PENDING: OrderPlaced.v1
    PENDING --> INVENTORY_RESERVED: InventoryReserved.v1
    PENDING --> CANCELLED: InventoryRejected.v1 -> OrderCancelled.v1
    PENDING --> CANCELLATION_PENDING: cancel request
    INVENTORY_RESERVED --> PAYMENT_AUTHORIZED: PaymentAuthorized.v1
    PAYMENT_AUTHORIZED --> FULFILLMENT_ASSIGNED: FulfillmentAssigned.v1
    FULFILLMENT_ASSIGNED --> PICKING: FulfillmentStatusChanged.v1 (PICKING)
    PICKING --> PACKED: FulfillmentStatusChanged.v1 (PACKED)
    PACKED --> DISPATCHED: FulfillmentStatusChanged.v1 (DISPATCHED)
    DISPATCHED --> DELIVERED: FulfillmentStatusChanged.v1 (DELIVERED)
    INVENTORY_RESERVED --> CANCELLATION_PENDING: PaymentDeclined.v1, or cancel request
    PAYMENT_AUTHORIZED --> CANCELLATION_PENDING: cancel request
    FULFILLMENT_ASSIGNED --> CANCELLATION_PENDING: cancel request / fulfillment cancelled
    PICKING --> CANCELLATION_PENDING: cancel request / fulfillment cancelled
    PACKED --> CANCELLATION_PENDING: cancel request / fulfillment cancelled
    CANCELLATION_PENDING --> CANCELLED: every required compensation confirmed -> OrderCancelled.v1
    CANCELLATION_PENDING --> REQUIRES_REVIEW: reconciliation gives up after one retry
    DISPATCHED --> REQUIRES_REVIEW: cancellation requested at/after DISPATCHED
    REQUIRES_REVIEW --> CANCELLATION_PENDING: operator CANCEL (not after dispatch)
    REQUIRES_REVIEW --> DISPATCHED: operator RESUME
    REQUIRES_REVIEW --> DELIVERED: operator RESUME (delivered during the review)
    CANCELLED --> [*]
    DELIVERED --> [*]
```

`CANCELLATION_PENDING` tracks which of {inventory release, payment refund, fulfillment cancellation}
an order needs, recorded in an `order_cancellation` row rather than in the order's status alone. The
requirements start from what Order Service had seen when cancellation started, and grow when a
milestone arrives late. A `PENDING` order also goes through it: its `OrderPlaced.v1` may already be
on its way, so the order waits for Inventory to release the stock or report that it reserved none.

Cancellation once a fulfillment reaches `DISPATCHED` is never automated: goods are physically in
transit, so that case routes to `REQUIRES_REVIEW` for a human decision, as does a cancellation that
ran out of retries. Reconciliation never moves a happy-path order into review; a stage past its SLA
threshold raises an `SLA_BREACHED` incident and the order keeps its status. An operator leaves review
with a decision (`POST /api/v1/ops/orders/{orderId}/review-decision`). RESUME returns the order to
the status it came from, or to a later milestone that arrived during the review. CANCEL starts or
retries compensation and is refused once the goods have left the warehouse.

### Invariants

- Inventory: `reservedQuantity + availableQuantity` never exceeds total stock for a SKU, and
  `availableQuantity` is never negative, even under concurrent reservation attempts for the same SKU.
- Payment: at most one non-refunded `Payment` per order (unique `order_id`), and at most one
  `Refund` per `Payment` (unique `payment_id`).
- Fulfillment: status only moves forward (`ASSIGNED → PICKING → PACKED → DISPATCHED → DELIVERED`),
  except operator-triggered `CANCELLED`, which is only reachable before `DISPATCHED`.
- Order: an idempotency key reused with a different request payload is rejected as a conflict,
  never treated as a duplicate success.
- Every consumer is idempotent by `eventId` — redelivery must not double-reserve, double-charge, or
  double-create a fulfillment.
- An order reaches `CANCELLED` only once every compensation its `order_cancellation` row requires
  has been confirmed — never on a partial set, and never twice.

## Kafka topics and event flow

One topic per producing service, named `sagaharbor.<service>.events` (not one topic per event
type). The Kafka message key is the order ID (`aggregateId`), preserving order within each producer
topic's partition; Kafka does not impose a total order across the four topics. Order Service builds
its operations projection by grouping events on the order ID. `eventId`,
`eventType`, `eventVersion`, `correlationId`, and `causationId` also ride along as Kafka headers so
tooling can identify a message without deserializing the JSON body (which remains the source of
truth).

| Topic | Producer |
|---|---|
| `sagaharbor.order.events` | Order Service |
| `sagaharbor.inventory.events` | Inventory Service |
| `sagaharbor.payment.events` | Payment Service |
| `sagaharbor.fulfillment.events` | Fulfillment Service |

Each consumer service has its own retry and dead-letter suffixes, for example
`sagaharbor.order.events-inventory-retry-500` and `sagaharbor.order.events-inventory-dlt`.
This keeps one service's failed delivery out of another service's retry and review queue.

Every envelope carries `eventId`, `eventType`, `eventVersion`, `occurredAt`, `correlationId`,
`causationId`, `aggregateId`, `producer`, and `payload`. The full event list, producers, and
consumers are in [`EVENT_CATALOG.md`](EVENT_CATALOG.md); the machine-validated wire format is in
[`../contracts/README.md`](../contracts/README.md).

```

## Transactional outbox and idempotent inbox

Services coordinate through choreography — each reacts to the events it needs and emits its own,
with no central orchestrator. Reliable delivery from a database transaction to Kafka uses the
transactional outbox on the producer side and an idempotent inbox on the consumer side.

- **Outbox.** Each service writes an event to its `outbox_event` table in the same transaction as
  its domain state change. A scheduled relay polls due rows (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), publishes
  them, and marks a row sent only after the broker acknowledges. A domain change and the fact that
  it happened are therefore never inconsistent — either both commit or neither does.
- **Inbox.** Each consumer records the `(event_id, consumer_name)` of every event it has processed
  and skips events it has already applied, in the same transaction as the work itself.

### At-least-once delivery and idempotency

Kafka delivery is at least once, never exactly once. Every consumer is written and tested against
redelivery of the same event. The inbox check makes reprocessing a no-op; domain-level uniqueness
constraints (a reservation, payment, or fulfillment keyed by `order_id`) are a second line of
defense if the inbox check is ever bypassed. **The project never claims exactly-once processing.**

## Compensation and reconciliation

Cancellation is choreographed the same way the happy path is. Order Service emits
`OrderCancellationRequested.v1` (or reacts directly to `PaymentDeclined.v1` / `InventoryRejected.v1`,
which need no separate command), and Inventory, Payment, and Fulfillment each independently release,
refund, or cancel whatever they own for that order, if anything. No command travels back to Order
Service, and no service queries another's database to find out what to compensate.

| Trigger | Compensation |
|---|---|
| `InventoryRejected.v1` | Order Service emits `OrderCancelled.v1` directly — nothing was reserved, payment never runs. |
| `PaymentDeclined.v1` | Inventory Service releases the reservation on its own reaction to the same event. Order Service waits for `InventoryReleased.v1`, then finalizes to `CANCELLED`. |
| Cancel request before `DISPATCHED` | Order Service computes which compensations the order needs, records `CANCELLATION_PENDING`, and emits `OrderCancellationRequested.v1`. It finalizes once every required confirmation (`InventoryReleased.v1` or `InventoryRejected.v1` / `PaymentRefunded.v1` / a fulfillment cancellation) arrives, in any order. Payment and Fulfillment record the request, so an `InventoryReserved.v1` or `PaymentAuthorized.v1` that reaches them later starts no new work. |
| Cancel request repeated (reconciliation retry, operator CANCEL) | Each service answers again: it compensates what it still holds, or re-publishes the confirmation of a compensation it already made, so a confirmation lost earlier can still arrive. |
| A work-started milestone for an order already `CANCELLED` | Order Service re-publishes the cancellation request, covering a service that never processed the original one. |
| Fulfillment cancelled directly (operator, before `DISPATCHED`) | Fulfillment emits `FulfillmentStatusChanged.v1` (`CANCELLED`); Inventory and Payment react as they would to a cancellation request; Order Service merges into `CANCELLATION_PENDING`. |
| Cancel request at or after `DISPATCHED` | Not automated. Order Service emits `OrderRequiresReview.v1` and opens a `CANCELLATION_AFTER_DISPATCH` incident for an operator. |
| A message fails processing repeatedly | Routed to the service's dead-letter topic after a bounded retry budget, and persisted so an ADMIN can find and replay it. |

**Payment and Fulfillment cancellation markers.** Each of the two services handles an order on two
consumer threads: one starts work (an authorization, a fulfillment), the other handles the
cancellation request. Both paths take a transaction-scoped Postgres advisory lock keyed by the order
id before they read or write the order's `order_cancellation_marker` row, so the check "was this
order cancelled?" and the write that makes it true never interleave. Whichever path comes second sees
what the first committed: the marker, and the work is skipped, or the finished work, which the
cancellation then compensates. Inventory needs no marker because `OrderPlaced.v1` and
`OrderCancellationRequested.v1` share a key and so a partition; if a retry reorders them,
reconciliation's retry releases the stock reserved after the cancellation.

**Reconciliation.** Order Service runs a scheduler with two jobs. A cancellation pending past
`app.reconciliation.cancellation-stuck-threshold` gets one safe retry (a verbatim re-publish of
`OrderCancellationRequested.v1`, safe because every consumer checks its own state first), then
escalates to `REQUIRES_REVIEW` with a deduplicated incident. An order in a happy-path stage longer
than that stage's threshold in `app.ops.sla.stage-thresholds` gets one `SLA_BREACHED` incident per
stage visit and keeps its status, so it continues as soon as its next event arrives. The thresholds
differ per stage because an automated step should finish in seconds while a warehouse step takes
people hours. Exactly one running instance ever acts on a pass:
the scheduler holds a Postgres session-scoped advisory lock on one dedicated JDBC connection for the
whole pass, so a lock acquired in one pooled connection is never orphaned on another.

### Failure categories

1. **Validation failure** — rejected synchronously with an RFC 9457 Problem Details response;
   nothing was persisted.
2. **Business rejection** — a valid request that cannot proceed (insufficient stock, declined
   payment). Handled by the compensation rules above and reflected in order status; never retried.
3. **Transient infrastructure failure** — a timeout or temporary unavailability. Retried
   automatically via a retry topic with backoff.
4. **Poison message** — fails processing repeatedly. Routed to a dead-letter topic after the retry
   budget is exhausted; never silently discarded.
5. **Irrecoverable inconsistency** — compensation itself keeps failing. The order is marked
   `REQUIRES_REVIEW` and surfaced in the incident queue for manual action.

## Operations projection

Order Service owns a read-optimized operations projection, built by consuming lifecycle events from
every other service in addition to its own. This gives the console one dependency for its primary
views instead of four, and lets it filter, sort, and paginate server-side. The projection is
read-only — never used to make authoritative decisions about inventory or payment state — and can
lag the owning service by however long event processing takes; that eventual-consistency window is
accepted and documented, not treated as a bug.

Projection writes happen inside the same `@Transactional` methods that already persist `orders` and
`order_status_history`, so they are atomic with the facts they derive from and inherit idempotency
from the calling listener's inbox check. An ADMIN-only rebuild recomputes the whole projection from
Order Service's own durable tables (not by replaying Kafka, whose retention is finite) — every event
this service ever processed already left a durable row before it advanced past it, so the rebuild is
a complete, deterministic reconstruction. The `/api/v1/ops/**` API (OPERATOR/ADMIN) exposes KPI
reads, a searchable/filterable/CSV-exportable work queue, per-order event timelines, and the
incident acknowledge/assign/resolve lifecycle — see [`KPI_DICTIONARY.md`](KPI_DICTIONARY.md).

Low-stock visibility follows the same events-only rule: Inventory Service emits `InventoryLowStock.v1`
(edge-triggered, only when a SKU crosses its threshold) rather than Order Service querying Inventory's
tables.

## Redis

Redis is used only for disposable, rebuildable caches; no service treats it as a system of record.
Inventory Service's availability read (`GET /api/v1/inventory/{sku}`) is cache-aside, evicted after
every committed reservation/release/adjustment — but PostgreSQL alone, never the cache, decides
whether a reservation succeeds. Order Service's KPI reads cache the expensive aggregate queries the
same way (TTL only). Every Redis call is wrapped so an outage degrades reads straight to PostgreSQL
and shows up only as a cache-failure metric, never a failed request.

## Authentication

Keycloak provides OIDC identity for local development; each backend service is a native Spring
Security OAuth2 Resource Server that validates a bearer JWT on every request and never issues tokens.
Validation checks the issuer and a required `sagaharbor-api` audience, and maps Keycloak's
`realm_access.roles` claim to Spring `ROLE_*` authorities. Three roles are recognized —
`CUSTOMER`, `OPERATOR`, `ADMIN` — enforced by both URL rules and service-layer ownership checks. No
service stores real payment-card data or real PII; see [`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) for the
full model.

## Observability

Every service exposes `/actuator/prometheus` (Micrometer) and ships OpenTelemetry traces over OTLP.
Trace context is W3C, propagated across HTTP and Kafka — and across the outbox boundary: the outbox
writer captures the active trace context when it writes a row, and the relay resumes it before
publishing, so an order is one continuous trace across all four services and every Kafka hop rather
than a new trace per publish. Structured JSON logs carry `service`, `environment`, `traceId`,
`spanId`, `correlationId`, `eventId`, and `aggregateId`, and never a token or a customer-data
payload. Metrics are bounded-cardinality (stage, outcome, event type — never a per-order or per-user
id). The local Compose stack adds Prometheus, Grafana, and Tempo, with provisioned dashboards and
demo-labeled alert rules for error rate, oldest outbox row, dead-letter growth, stuck orders,
reconciliation failure, and service-down.

## Key engineering decisions

- **Four services split by business capability, each owning its own database.** Real service
  boundaries, not one application in folders. No service has network or credential access to
  another's database; all cross-service communication is HTTP or events. This is what makes the
  outbox/inbox and choreography necessary rather than optional.
- **Choreography, not a central orchestrator.** Each service reacts to events and emits its own.
  No single point of control means no single point of failure for the whole workflow; the cost is
  that the flow is understood by reading event contracts and the state machine, not one file. At
  four services that is a reasonable trade; a much larger participant count would favor an
  orchestrator.
- **Transactional outbox on publish, idempotent inbox on consume.** A domain change and the event
  announcing it commit together, and redelivery is a safe no-op. The cost is an outbox relay and an
  inbox table in every service.
- **Design for at-least-once delivery; never claim exactly-once.** Every consumer is idempotent by
  `eventId` plus domain uniqueness constraints. This is honest about a real Kafka limitation rather
  than a claim that would not survive scrutiny.
- **Versioned JSON Schema event contracts, not shared Java classes.** A shared model module would
  re-introduce the coupling the service split removes. A breaking change ships as a new
  `eventVersion` rather than mutating an existing schema.
- **PostgreSQL per service.** Strong per-service consistency (transactions, unique constraints,
  `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) for the invariants that matter most — no oversold inventory, no duplicate
  authorization — while making cross-service joins impossible even by accident.
- **Keycloak for OIDC, a Resource Server per service.** Token validation and role authorization use
  a well-established library consistently, and each service is testable for authorization behavior
  on its own. Production identity federation is out of scope.
- **Order Service owns the operations projection.** The console has one dependency for its primary
  views instead of four. Order Service takes on a read model over facts it does not own the write
  path for, scoped narrowly to reads so it never becomes a second source of truth.
- **Kafka: one topic per producer, keyed by order ID; Spring Kafka's native retry/DLT.** Ordering
  is guaranteed within a topic partition, and retry/dead-lettering uses first-party `@RetryableTopic` with
  exception-based routing rather than a general-purpose resilience library that has no Kafka
  integration.
- **Resilience4j core libraries for the payment provider call.** The retry and circuit breaker
  around the simulated provider use Resilience4j's framework-agnostic core (`resilience4j-retry`,
  `resilience4j-circuitbreaker`, `resilience4j-micrometer`) wired by hand — a genuinely different
  concern from Kafka consumer retry, and independent of any Spring Boot starter version. A business
  decline is a return value, never an exception, so it can never trigger a retry or count against
  the circuit breaker.
