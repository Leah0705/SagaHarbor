# Testing strategy

SagaHarbor is tested at levels matched to what each can actually prove:

1. **Unit tests (JUnit 5 + Mockito)** — pure logic: pricing, status-transition tables, simulator
   rules, KPI formulas, authorization mapping, and ArchUnit boundary rules.
2. **Web-slice tests (`@WebMvcTest` + Spring Security Test)** — controller authorization and request
   validation without a full context.
3. **Integration tests (Failsafe + Testcontainers)** — the parts that are only real against real
   infrastructure: Flyway migrations, the transactional outbox/inbox, concurrency
   (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, optimistic locking), Kafka retry/DLT routing, the compensation saga, and
   reconciliation — all against real PostgreSQL, Kafka, and Redis containers.
4. **Frontend tests** — Vitest component/unit tests and Playwright end-to-end tests against the
   console's self-contained demo mode. A separate Playwright scenario exercises the live
   four-service Messaging flow; its database outcome is recorded in
   [`DEMO.md`](DEMO.md#where-evidence-is-stored).

Contract safety is its own check: the `contracts` module validates every event example fixture against
its JSON Schema, so a schema and its documented example can never drift.

## Commands

```
./mvnw -B test                     # unit + web-slice tests (no Docker needed)
./mvnw -B verify                   # adds Testcontainers integration tests + the coverage gate
./mvnw -B -pl contracts test       # event-contract (schema/example) validation only
make smoke                         # JWT auth end to end against the running stack
make smoke-inventory / -payment / -fulfillment / -cancellation / -operations
cd apps/ops-console && npm test    # Vitest
cd apps/ops-console && npm run e2e # Playwright
make verify-all                    # every feasible local check at once
```

## Test inventory

- **Unit + web-slice tests** run with `./mvnw -B test` (no Docker): contracts, order-service,
  inventory-service, payment-service, and fulfillment-service each carry their own suite covering the
  business rules above.
- **Integration tests**: 40 `*IT.java` files across the four services, run with `./mvnw -B verify`.
  They need a working Docker daemon — Testcontainers starts its own throwaway PostgreSQL/Kafka/Redis
  containers, independent of the Compose stack.

Run the commands above to produce current pass counts for your environment; this document does not
hard-code a count that a later change could make stale.

## Coverage

A JaCoCo gate runs at `verify` on **business code only** — the service, domain, messaging, and web
layers, with generated configuration and DTO records excluded so the number reflects logic worth
testing. Unit and integration coverage are captured separately and merged, so the gate sees both.

The gate (`coverage.business.line.minimum` in the root `pom.xml`) is a deliberately conservative line
floor. Most of this codebase's coverage comes from the integration tests, so a meaningful figure
requires running `./mvnw -B verify` with Docker available; unit tests alone exercise a much smaller
fraction. Ratchet the floor up toward the measured unit+integration figure once it is known for your
environment.

On 2026-09-30, a local `./mvnw -B verify` with Testcontainers passed all four service gates. The
merged JaCoCo reports recorded business-code line coverage of 81.8% (Order), 85.5% (Inventory),
85.2% (Payment), and 82.9% (Fulfillment). These are local test figures, not production coverage.

## Performance (k6) — measured, with limits stated

Three k6 scripts under [`../tests/perf/`](../tests/perf/) were run against the real local stack; the
raw summaries are committed in [`evidence/k6/`](evidence/k6/). Exactly as measured:

| Scenario | Iterations | Failed requests | p95 latency | Demo target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Order submission (10 VUs, 30s) | 471 | 0% | 889 ms | 500 ms (missed) |
| Ops work-queue (10 VUs, 30s) | 984 | 0% | 359 ms | 300 ms (missed) |
| Mixed read+write (8+8 VUs, 30s) | 1309 | 0% | 506 ms | 700 ms (met) |

**These are not capacity numbers.** They were produced on a single shared ~7.8 GB sandbox running
Postgres, Kafka, Redis, Keycloak, Prometheus, Grafana, Tempo, all four JVMs, and the test process at
once. Every request succeeded (0% errors); two of three p95 latency targets were missed under that
load. Reported unadjusted — re-run on a described machine before quoting any latency figure elsewhere.
