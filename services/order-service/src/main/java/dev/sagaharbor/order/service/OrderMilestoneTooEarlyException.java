/**
 * Thrown when an event implies a status transition Order Service isn't ready to apply yet because
 * an earlier milestone for this order hasn't been processed — for example, PaymentAuthorized
 * arriving while the order is still PENDING (InventoryReserved not yet processed). Different
 * producers' topics carry no cross-topic ordering guarantee, so this is expected under normal
 * operation, not a bug. Deliberately not a NonRetryableEventProcessingException: @RetryableTopic
 * gives the missing predecessor event time to be processed first.
