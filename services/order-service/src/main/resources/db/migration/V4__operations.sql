-- The operations read model — a denormalized, rebuildable projection built
-- from the same lifecycle events OrderLifecycleTransaction/OrderCancellationTransaction/
-- OrderRequiresReviewTransaction already apply to orders/order_status_history, plus the
-- incident acknowledge/assign/resolve lifecycle and low-stock visibility. See
-- docs/KPI_DICTIONARY.md for the KPI formulas these tables back.

-- These three facts only ever arrive in a Kafka event payload (InventoryRejected.reasonCode,
-- PaymentDeclined/PaymentAuthorized.reasonCode/precedingTechnicalFailureCount) — nothing else in
-- this service's durable tables records them. Storing them on orders itself (not just the
-- projection) is what makes OperationsProjectionRebuildService's rebuild actually complete:
-- without this, a rebuilt projection would come back with these three columns null for any order
-- that ever had an inventory rejection or payment decline, even though the live-built projection
-- had them set.

-- One row per order, kept in sync in the same transaction as the order_status_history
-- write that already happens on every lifecycle event — see OperationsProjectionUpdater.
-- Denormalized on purpose: the ops work queue/KPI reads need to filter and sort across
-- many dimensions cheaply, without joining orders/order_status_history/order_cancellation/
-- operations_incident on every request. version exists because three independent Kafka
-- listener threads (inventory/payment/fulfillment topics) can race to update the same
-- order's projection row during cancellation — the same lost-update risk order_cancellation
-- already hit once — applied here proactively instead of waiting to rediscover it.
