-- The cancellation saga, operations incidents, and dead-letter recovery.
-- See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for the state machine and compensation rules these
-- tables enforce.

-- CANCELLATION_PENDING is a new intermediate status: an order sits here while
-- Order Service waits for whichever of {inventory release, payment refund,
-- fulfillment cancellation} it actually needs to be confirmed by the owning
-- service, before finalizing to CANCELLED. Postgres has no ALTER-CHECK-to-add-
-- one-value shortcut, so the constraint is dropped and recreated with the new
-- value included — the names below are Postgres's own default naming for an
-- unnamed inline column CHECK (<table>_<column>_check), unchanged since
-- V2__orders.sql defined them.
ALTER TABLE orders DROP CONSTRAINT orders_status_check;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT orders_status_check
    CHECK (status IN (
        'PENDING', 'INVENTORY_RESERVED', 'PAYMENT_AUTHORIZED',
        'FULFILLMENT_ASSIGNED', 'PICKING', 'PACKED', 'DISPATCHED',
        'DELIVERED', 'CANCELLATION_PENDING', 'CANCELLED', 'REQUIRES_REVIEW'
    ));

ALTER TABLE order_status_history DROP CONSTRAINT order_status_history_status_check;
ALTER TABLE order_status_history ADD CONSTRAINT order_status_history_status_check
    CHECK (status IN (
        'PENDING', 'INVENTORY_RESERVED', 'PAYMENT_AUTHORIZED',
        'FULFILLMENT_ASSIGNED', 'PICKING', 'PACKED', 'DISPATCHED',
        'DELIVERED', 'CANCELLATION_PENDING', 'CANCELLED', 'REQUIRES_REVIEW'
    ));

-- One row per order that has ever entered CANCELLATION_PENDING: which
-- compensations it actually needs (computed once, from what had already
-- happened for that order at the moment cancellation started) and which of
-- those have been confirmed so far. OrderCancellationFinalizer finalizes the
-- order to CANCELLED once every required flag is confirmed. A required flag
-- can later flip from false to true (never the reverse) if a milestone event
-- for this order arrives after cancellation already started — see
-- OrderLifecycleTransaction's handling of that race. version backs optimistic
-- locking: inventory release, payment refund, and fulfillment cancellation
-- confirmations each arrive on a different Kafka topic, consumed on a
-- different listener thread, so two of them can genuinely race to update this
-- same row — without a version check that's a silent lost update (one
-- confirmation's write quietly overwritten by another's stale read), not a
-- visible error, and the order is then stuck in CANCELLATION_PENDING forever.
