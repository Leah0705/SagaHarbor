 * A short, jittered pause between bounded in-process retries of an optimistic-lock conflict.

 * instant too, colliding again — under heavy contention (many concurrent reservations for one SKU)
 * that can starve a single unlucky thread out of its whole retry budget. The pause grows with the
 * attempt number, capped, so early retries stay fast and only sustained contention slows down.
