verify: ## Full build: format check, compile, unit tests, coverage report.
	./mvnw -B clean verify

format: ## Reformat all Java sources in place.
	./mvnw -B spotless:apply

format-check: ## Fail if any Java source is not formatted.
	./mvnw -B spotless:check

test: ## Run unit tests only, skip the full verify lifecycle.
	./mvnw -B test

build: verify

docker-build: ## Build all four service images locally (no push).

audit: ## Audit the repo: required docs/screenshots, broken links, secrets, README commands, evidence.
	./scripts/audit-repo.sh

# The run-* targets source .env into the shell environment so Spring Boot's
# ${ORDER_DB_PASSWORD}-style placeholders resolve, matching what infra-up expects
# to already be running. See docs/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md.

smoke-inventory: ## Create stock, place a real order, and observe the resulting Inventory event on Kafka.

smoke-payment: ## Place one normal-priced and one seeded-decline-priced order, and observe both PaymentAuthorized/PaymentDeclined events on Kafka.
	./scripts/smoke-payment-authorization.sh

smoke-fulfillment: ## Place a normal-priced order and follow it to a real FulfillmentAssigned.v1 event, then confirm it via the operator API.
