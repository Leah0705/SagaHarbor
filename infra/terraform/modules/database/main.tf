# A single, cost-conscious RDS PostgreSQL instance. Each service owns its own database on
# this instance (created by the services' own Flyway migrations against per-service
# credentials) — the "database per service" boundary is preserved without paying for four
# separate instances. Stricter isolation would use one instance per service; that is a
# cost/isolation trade-off documented in README.md.
#
# The master password is managed by RDS and stored in Secrets Manager (no password ever
# appears in a variable, in state as plaintext, or in this code).
