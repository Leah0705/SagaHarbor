# Failure demo: places several orders at the seeded fictional amount 9998.00 — every
# attempt against the simulator is a technical failure at that amount (see V2__payments.sql,
# "for demonstrating retry exhaustion and the circuit breaker opening") — and watches the
# payment-provider circuit breaker trip to OPEN. Then places a normal-priced order once the
# (shortened, for this demo) wait-duration-in-open-state has elapsed, and confirms the circuit
# recovers to CLOSED and the healthy order is still authorized normally. Starts order-service,
# inventory-service, and payment-service locally against the running Compose infra and stops
# them on exit. Safe and reversible: uses only the simulator's existing seeded fictional test
# amounts, no production code or data is touched.
