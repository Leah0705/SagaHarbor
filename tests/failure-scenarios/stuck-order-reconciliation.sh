# Failure demo: starts order-service and inventory-service only — deliberately leaving
# payment-service down — so a placed order reserves stock and then has nowhere to go, stuck in
# INVENTORY_RESERVED. Runs order-service with a drastically shortened reconciliation interval and
# stuck-threshold (seconds instead of the production-realistic 60s/30m — see application.yml) so
# this demo doesn't have to wait half an hour, and confirms reconciliation opens an incident for
# the stuck order. Then starts payment-service (and fulfillment-service) to show the order
# recovers on its own once the missing piece comes back. Stops every service it started on exit.
# Safe and reversible: only ever appends rows, nothing is deleted.
