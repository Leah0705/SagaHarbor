# Security

SagaHarbor has a real security posture for the things that matter in a fulfillment backend:
authentication, authorization, data ownership, and not leaking secrets. It processes **no real money
and no real personal data** — every credential, user, and payment amount in this repository is
fictional and valid only against the local Docker Compose stack.

## Authentication

- Every service is a native **Spring Security OAuth2 Resource Server** (not a Keycloak adapter). It
  validates a bearer **JWT** on each request; it never issues tokens.
- Tokens are issued by a local **Keycloak** realm (`sagaharbor`) over OIDC. The realm, its three
  fictional demo users, and its clients are in `infra/keycloak/realm-export.json`.
- Validation checks the **issuer** (`OIDC_ISSUER_URI`) and a required **audience**: the token must
  carry `sagaharbor-api`, or it is rejected. Keycloak's `realm_access.roles` claim maps to Spring
  `ROLE_*` authorities.
- Public endpoints (no token): `GET /actuator/health/**`, `/actuator/info`, and
  `/actuator/prometheus`. Everything under `/api/**` requires a valid token.

## Authorization

Three roles, enforced both by URL rules in each `SecurityConfig` and by ownership checks in the
service layer:

| Role | Can do |
|---|---|
| `CUSTOMER` | Place orders, read/track **their own** orders, request cancellation of their own order. A non-owner gets `404`, not `403`, so they cannot distinguish "not yours" from "doesn't exist". |
| `OPERATOR` | Work the fulfillment queue and the incident lifecycle; advance fulfillments; cancel before dispatch. Cannot place customer orders. |
| `ADMIN` | Everything an operator can, plus refunds, inventory adjustments, dead-letter list/replay, and operations-projection rebuild. |

Command endpoints that change state require an `Idempotency-Key` (order/refund/adjustment) or an
`If-Match` version (fulfillment), so retries and races cannot double-apply.

## Data protection

- **No real payment or personal data, ever.** No card number, bank detail, or SSN is accepted,
  logged, or stored anywhere. The payment service is a deterministic simulator driven only by the
  order amount.
- **No secret is logged.** Structured logs carry `correlationId`, `eventId`, `aggregateId`,
  `traceId`/`spanId`, and a safe error classification — never a token or a customer-data payload.
- **No cross-service data access.** No service reads or writes another service's tables; data moves
  only as events, and payment events carry no card-shaped fields (see
  [`docs/EVENT_CATALOG.md`](docs/EVENT_CATALOG.md)).

## Secrets and configuration

- All credentials in this repo (Keycloak users, database passwords, Redis password, client secrets)
  are fictional and local-only. None is a real credential.
- Services read database/Kafka/Redis/OIDC settings from **environment variables with no defaults** —
  a missing variable fails startup with a clear error rather than silently using a production-looking
  value. `.env` is git-ignored; only the fictional `.env.example` is committed.
- In Kubernetes, passwords come from a Secret created out of band; the committed `secret.example.yaml`
  holds only placeholders and is excluded from the Kustomize build. The AWS Terraform reference uses
  an RDS-managed master password stored in Secrets Manager.

## Error handling

All HTTP errors use **RFC 9457 Problem Details**. A generic 500 returns a fixed, non-leaking message;
the real exception is logged server-side only. No stack trace or secret is ever returned to a caller.

## Console (browser)

The ops console signs in with **Authorization Code + PKCE** against Keycloak. Tokens are held in
`sessionStorage`, **never in `localStorage`**, so they are cleared when the tab closes. Script running
in the page could still read them, as it could read tokens held in memory, so preventing XSS is the
real defense. Service container images run as a **non-root** user.

## Threat-model summary

A lightweight STRIDE pass over the parts that matter here:

| Threat | Example | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Spoofing** | Caller forges identity | JWT signature + issuer + `sagaharbor-api` audience validation on every request |
| **Tampering** | Client sets its own price/total or customer id | Server computes totals from SKU/quantity/price; request body has no `customerId`/`totalAmount` |
| **Repudiation** | "I didn't make that change" | Append-only status/adjustment history with actor, reason, correlation id, timestamp |
| **Information disclosure** | Card/PII leak, non-owner reads an order | No card/PII fields exist; non-owner reads return `404`; no secrets in logs or Problem Details |
| **Denial of service** | Retry storm, poison message, hot-SKU contention | Bounded retry + DLT per consumer; `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` serializes hot-SKU contention; idempotency keys |
| **Elevation of privilege** | Customer calls an admin endpoint | Role rules in `SecurityConfig` **and** service-layer ownership checks, verified by authorization tests |

### Out of scope

Rate limiting, WAF, mTLS between services, secret rotation, and real PII handling are out of scope —
this project does not process real money or real personal data. See
[`docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`](docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).

## Reporting a concern

If you find a security issue in the code — a way a service could read another service's data, an
authorization gap, or a committed secret — please open a GitHub issue describing it, or contact the
maintainer directly. There is no bug-bounty program. Because nothing here is deployed and no real
data is handled, there is no production incident process; the goal of a report is to correct the code
and the documented model.

The project is pre-1.0 and unreleased; only `main` is maintained.
